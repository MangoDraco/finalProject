Hello! This readme will also be available in the build upload, as I know it's an important part of the project. 

I, Lexx Walker, am the only team member for the final project, as my other team members in the previous coding assignment swapped to another team without letting me know, so I missed that ship. It's fine though, because it worked out better for this to be a solo project. 
The modifications I made to the game is:
Major Mod: You add a UI element to the game. It is a timer! John Lemon has to reach the end of the level at a certain time or the game ends.
Minor Mod: You add a speed boost to the game. While the player is holding down a button, the character moves faster.
